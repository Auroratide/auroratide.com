Back in 2017, I was having a hard time figuring out how to test things in Unity, and like a complete madman decided to invent my own testing framework rather than figure out how to integrate NSubstitute or something like that. That's what NBehave is: a Unity-specific testing framework, featuring standard testing facilities like mocks and stubs as well as fake Unity components and processes.
