This is an HTML5 webgame made with Construct 2 for [Ludum Dare 34](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=60770). A couple friends and I tirelessly toiled for some percentage of a 72-hour time limit to make a game surrounded around the theme "Two-button controls". Well, we decided they didn't tell us _how many_ two-button controls we could have, and hence now this monstrous game exists. It's a co-op game, so make sure you've got a friend with you if you want to try it!
