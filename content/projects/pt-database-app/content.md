The PT Database App offers:

* The ability to manage multiple databases, presumably for multiple academic semesters
* The ability to actually assign labs to peer teachers based on a master list of all available courses (in the first version, these had to be hard-coded)
* The ability to assign office hours to peer teachers
* Automatic detection of conflicts between assigned labs, office hours, and the peer teachers' personal course schedules
* The ability to import course schedules in bulk
* The ability to export CSV files of the current assignments
* The ability to generate the web page to an HTML file

This project was created in Haxe using the OpenFL, HaxeUI, and systools libraries.
