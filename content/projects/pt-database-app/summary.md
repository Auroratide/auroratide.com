The PT Database App is an application for the Texas A&M computer science department to manage schedules for its peer teacher program. Peer teachers help students in class labs by answering questions and offering advice, but with over 50 PTs in the program, managing all of their schedules and updating the website can be a pain. This app serves as a one-way stop for assigning classes, managing office hours, and generating web content.
