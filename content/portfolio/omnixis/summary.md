Omnixis is an HTML5 webgame made with HaxeFlixel for [Ludum Dare 35](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=93230). In Ludum Dare, participants only have 72 hours to make a game from scratch given a theme. This time, the theme was "Shapeshift", and I decided it was time to make a Tetris clone. Except, it totally isn't a clone, and I'm not just saying that. Out of nearly 3000 entries, Omnixis was voted the 23rd most innovative game.
