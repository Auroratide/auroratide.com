Monado Recipes is a fan-made repository of recipes based on food found in the [Xenoblade Chronicles](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Xenoblade_Wiki) games.

Really, it's one big creative culinary exercise: how do you take fantasy ingredients like "Mookah Flour" and create a "Pan-Fried Tatari"? What even is a tatari anyway?

The website was made in a weekend with my brother when I was visiting him, and we add new recipes from time to time.

Monado Recipes is built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) statically hosted via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The website is simple, so the tech stack is simple! And of course, I build it to be as accessible as possible.
