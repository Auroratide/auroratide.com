Key features include:

* **Generic**: It is designed to be useable on any website
* **Customizable**: All the colors are customizable if the default red and black doesn't _suit_ you
* **Accessible**: Treats the card as an image with alternative text detailing the value and suit

Originally made for a small game called [Nimcard](/portfolio/nimcard) when I realized the card component could easily be extracted as its own reusable element.
