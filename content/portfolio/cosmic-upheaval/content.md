When I was a first-year college student, our game developer club held a contest of sorts. The goal was to make a game using GameMaker in just a week. It was my first time using software devoted to the trade rather than cobbling scraps of pure code together, so it was challenging getting into the paradigm. Nonetheless, what you see before you was the winning entry: A funky game about a sun killing other suns.

Cosmic Upheaval is a quick little side-scroll shooting game in which you play the role of an anti-matter star. You were somehow teleported into a real-matter universe, and all the real-matter stars want to kill you! Now you must navigate the universe while ensuring that these stars do not annihilate all of your mass.

The main goal of the game is to achieve the highest score you can. Points are earned by surviving and annihilating enemy stars. To destroy a star, all you have to do is shoot it until its mass is depleted. The twist, however, is that shooting also expends your own mass, and therefore one must have good discretion before firing.

The game features five different bosses which represent actual stars in our galaxy. If you manage to defeat the last boss, then you deserve unlimited cookies.

Cosmic Upheaval is only compatible with Windows.
