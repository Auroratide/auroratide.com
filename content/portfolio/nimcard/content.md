Nimcard is a two-player strategy game involving standard playing cards! The game is programmed with an optimal (yet beatable) AI.

* The **goal** of the game is to collect cards totalling the higher score
* Any number of cards are arranged into rows face up so the value is showing
* The **Queen of Diamonds** is always the last card on the last row
* Players take turns taking either one card or two cards from a single row
* The game ends once all cards have been claimed

For scoring, add up the values of all the cards you claimed.

* Numerical cards are worth their value
* Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points
* Aces are worth 11 points
* The **Queen of Diamonds**, however, is worth -10 points!

## Why I Made This

Nimcard was a game I made as a puzzle for friends in our [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/) campaign. They were in a casino-based city and could only earn an audience with the so-called "King of Clubs" by winning this game.

In the meantime, from a skills point of view, I also used Nimcard to practice an immutable functional style and learn how to use [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).
