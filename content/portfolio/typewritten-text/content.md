`typewritten-text` is a web component for animating text by typing out one letter at a time! This common animation is often known as the "typewriter effect", and is often seen on code-themed websites.

Key features include:

* **Generic**: It is designed to be useable on any website
* **Customizable**: It is customizable in exactly the same way any HTML element is customizable
* **Accessible**: No content shifting, and reads well with screen readers, disables blinking for those who prefer reduced motion

I originally made this in response to a series of posts others were making on a developer site called [dev.to](https://dev.to). People were making CSS- and HTML-only versions of the typewriter effect in some sort of unspoken contest, which prompted me to make two entries of my own:

* <cite>[A Typewriter, but with no HTML, CSS, or JS](https://dev.to/auroratide/a-typewriter-but-with-no-html-css-or-js-1bgd)</cite>, featuring an SVG-only solution
* <cite>[A Typewriter, but using a New HTML Tag](https://dev.to/auroratide/a-typewriter-but-using-a-new-html-tag-60i)</cite>, featuring this web component

In the end, the post was well-received with several thousand views!
