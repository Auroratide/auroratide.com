While working for ThoughtWorks, one of my clients was using Microsoft's VSTS to manage running tests and deployments. At the time, the tool didn't have a very good visualization of this process, though, and this led to our team not knowing whether the build was succeeding, or if something failed, what failed. So in a few hours I hacked up my own monitor consuming VSTS's API, and soon enough the monitor saw use by other teams within the same client.
