I was responsible for the content on the peer teacher section of the website and not the entire site itself. When I was first hired to manage the site, I found that the workflow was not as efficient as it could be. Adding new peer teachers entailed shifting all of the other entries individually. As a result, I created **[a program](/portfolio/pt-database-app)** that manages everyone's schedules and auto-creates the webpage on the peer teacher site.

I worked carefully with the professor in charge of the peer teacher program and two other peer teachers.
