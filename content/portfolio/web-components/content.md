After developing a number of reusable web components, I created a hub to document them all together.

Think of <dfn>web components</dfn> like brand new building blocks that any web developer can freely use to build websites. A reorderable list, for example, is a very common concept across all sites, and yet there's no building block that just gives you a reorderable list.

I have shared `reorder-list` as a web component so that other developers do not necessarily have to code it from scratch themselves! That's just one example; I've also made things like [tabs](https://auroratide.github.io/web-components/tab-list) and a [toggle switch](https://auroratide.github.io/web-components/toggle-switch).

My web component hub is an instruction manual for how developers can use these tools. I love web components because, unlike developing something for a specific tool such as React, web components can be used literally anywhere.
