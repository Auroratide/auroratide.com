I designed this tool mainly to help post nice pretty code on Wikidot sites like this. I wanted something more powerful than Wikidot's native highlighter, and I wanted the potential to support as many languages as possible. This code.highlight() program achieves just that. By defining simple rules, potentially any language can have custom highlighting. This was my first major experience with parsing.
