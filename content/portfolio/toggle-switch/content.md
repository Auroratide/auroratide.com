`toggle-switch` is a web component for the humble switch component that lots of websites use for things like toggling preferences. I constructed this element mainly to serve a full tutorial of mine, **[Making a Toggle Switch](/posts/making-a-toggle-switch)**, which covers how to build a web component from the ground up while considering accessibility, testability, and customizability.

Key features include:

* **Generic**: It is designed to be useable on any website
* **Customizable**: It provides a flexible styling interface to make switches of all sorts
* **Accessible**: It follows the WAI-ARIA guidelines for the [switch role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#switch)

My making this component was a followup to my popular [typewritten-text](/portfolio/typewritten-text), which had amassed thousands of views and downloads. As a teacher, I wanted to thoroughly show the _how_, using the `toggle-switch` as a demonstration.
