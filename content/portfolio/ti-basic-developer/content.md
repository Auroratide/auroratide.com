The TI-Basic Developer is a repository for information regarding the TI-Basic programming language on TI's graphic calculators. The website contains multiple encyclopedic entries of techniques, documentation of all available functions, and an archive for programs developed by users.

I loved programming calculators. I loved it so much so, in fact, that I became an active member of the TI-Basic community and contributed quite a bit to its wiki. Eventually becoming an administrator, I helped the community grow by writing several beginner tutorials, pioneering TI-Nspire programming, and writing the backend for the site's program archive system.

Although I no longer actively contribute to the wiki, the site still grows strong, and I'm proud to say that I'm a part of its history.
