Aella was one of the main protagonists of a Fire Emblem game me and a fellow geek were devising back in college. She starts off as a woodsgirl but is eventually discovered to be a descendant of the first Wind Sage, making her one of a few in the world capable of unsealing the Wind Emblem.

At the time, it was unusual for a Fire Emblem unit to have access to both physical and magic damage. Aella starts off as an archer but can later use wind magic, and some of her attacks could do both physical and magic damage simultaneously.
