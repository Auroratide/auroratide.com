I participated in a game jam for a local game dev group, where the theme was all about ye olde cartridge games. The idea was people would make the covers of theoretical cartridge games, and then exchange them with other teams; they would make _your_ cartridge game, and you would make theirs.

I deviated from the normal style of cartridge covers and deliberately made something meant to appear ominous. Lacking even a title, you weren't supposed to know what sort of game you're playing until you start it.

"Echo Cell" was just the name of the file, but otherwise the game could be anything.
