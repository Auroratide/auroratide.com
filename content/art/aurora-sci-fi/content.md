Since high school or something, "Aurora" has been a consistent character throughout my fictional ideas, mostly only changing depending on the setting. At the time I drew this, Aurora was, unknowingly, an artificial intelligence living at a space colony. In fact, the was the only model working, and the scientists eventually planned on using her mind to end all suffering.

As my first digital character drawing, the design is somewhat simplistic. The most interesting thing about this version of Aurora is her heterochromia and how she uses her hair to hide one of her eyes.

I have since abandoned this particular fiction arc (the "sci fi" arc, I call it), but Aurora as a character still exists in my most recent brainspace...
