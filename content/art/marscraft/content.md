Marscraft is a texture pack I made for Minecraft meant to make the world look a lot more like Mars. Since it's just a reskinning, plants and trees still grow on the surface, an impossibility on real Mars, but the "greenery" has been made to look a bit more... alien.

Almost every block, including the Nether dimension, had to be recolored to match the red hue of Mars. I even went through the trouble of resizing the sun, turning the rain into a dust storm, and changing the armor into space suits.

The texture pack is very old now and is only compatible up to Minecraft 1.5.2. But if you like old Minecraft, feel free to download the pack below and play on the surface of Mars!
