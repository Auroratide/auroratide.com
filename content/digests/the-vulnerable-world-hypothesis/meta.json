  "summary": "The Vulnerable World Hypothesis stipulates that civilation is at risk of major destabilization for as long as the possibility exists that a particularly destructive technology becomes discovered or made accessible. Bostrom advocates for stronger surveilance and global governance in order curtail the risk, outlining how such measures would address, possibly comprehensively, the various types of technologically-induced existential threats facing humanity. I may not agree with everything, but it's a fascinating read.",
