  "summary": "When developing software, we sometimes find ourselves needing to perform certain technical tasks (such as anything DevOps realted) which may invisible to our end users. However, we wouldn't do these tasks if they didn't provide value to someone. Bangser proposes we think of these \"tech tasks\" as proper user stories, to help communicate their value to our clients and ourselves.",
