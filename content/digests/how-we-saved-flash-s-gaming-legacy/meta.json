  "summary": "As a game developer born in the 90s, I fondly remember the many hundreds of Adobe Flash games I played, games that inspired me to learn programming for myself. Sometimes I miss those days, and so I am incredibly grateful for the efforts that Latimore and others have put into preserving Flash's legacy and the creativity of its era.",
