  "summary": "When it comes to improving one's self, deliberate practice is more important than amount of practice, and a huge part of deliberate practice is seeking feedback from others. That said, we should seek (and give) feedback that takes us out of our comfort zone but not out of our safe zone. When out of our comfort zone, we grow because we're forced to adapt, but outside our safe zone it is easy to become emotionally discouraged.",
