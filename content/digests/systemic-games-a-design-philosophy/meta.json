  "summary": "In a systemic game, the world is composed of a variety of interconnected systems that interact with each other based on simple and consistent rules. These simple rules give rise to complex and emergent behaviour, granting the game a certain richness. Systemic games are perfect playgrounds for players, allowing them to discover the rules and their consequences, consequences that may even be unintended (though no less fun) by the developers.",
