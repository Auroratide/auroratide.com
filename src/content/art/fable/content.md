Fable is the main protagonist in a game a friend and I are sporadically developing. Despite living in what is essentially the magic capital of the world and possessing talent above most of her peers, her casual personality has kept her far from academic achievement. Instead she devotes her time to adventuring the downtown and practicing magical "hacking".

Fable never leaves home without her hat. Actually she's got several, each with a different ribbon and engraved spell that changes the color of her hair. In the end, pink is her favorite color.

This drawing is the first piece of concept art ever made for the aforementioned game.
