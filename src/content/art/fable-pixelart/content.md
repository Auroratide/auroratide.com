Fable is the main protagonist in a game a friend and I are sporadically developing. Despite living in what is essentially the magic capital of the world and possessing talent above most of her peers, her casual personality has kept her far from academic achievement. Instead she devotes her time to adventuring the downtown and practicing magical "hacking".

I have a friend who's a master pixelartist, and with his guidance I was able to make this tiny redition of Fable, based on the style of the original Cave Story game. See [Fable's concept art](/art/fable) for a comparison.
