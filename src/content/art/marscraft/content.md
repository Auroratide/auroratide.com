Marscraft is a texture pack I made for Minecraft meant to make the world look a lot more like Mars. Since it's just a reskinning, plants and trees still grow on the surface, an impossibility on real Mars, but the "greenery" has been made to look a bit more... alien.

Almost every block, including the Nether dimension, had to be recolored to match the red hue of Mars. I even went through the trouble of resizing the sun, turning the rain into a dust storm, and changing the armor into space suits.
