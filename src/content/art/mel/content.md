Mel is a character I am running for a contemporary tabletop rpg called [Triangle Agency](https://www.hauntedtable.games/). She's a "Loose Ends Coordinator" at the agency, which means she's in charge of ensuring nobody outside the agency knows what the agency actually does. Usually this means dispatching teams to convince witnesses that what they may have seen is either normal or imagined. But failing that, Mel will simply... _erase_ any "loose ends" from existence.

See, that's her **anomalous power**. Mel does not know why, but whenever she calls 911 on her flip phone, whatever or whoever she's thinking of will simply vanish from existence. Though terrifying, she won't hesitate to use it if it means covering her tracks and keeping her safe from the mysterious forces that seek to capture and _torture_ her.

Mel can come off as a bit blunt, cynical, and dismissive, but that's because she gets so little sleep. And although she claims its due to overwork, in reality, nightmares of her pursuers, memories of what _they've done_, haunt her every night.
