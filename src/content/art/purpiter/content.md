Purpiter is a fictional exoplanet that probably doesn't exist, though it'd be cool if it did. It's a gas giant planet kind of like Saturn or Jupiter, except the clouds are purple and pink instead of brown and red. That distinct hue probably comes from iodine gas.

Purpiter is better than Jupiter because instead of one great red spot, it has three swirling around each other.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

I whipped this small piece up in a couple hours for an article I was writing, [Image Alt Text, the Way the Spec Intended It](/posts/image-alt-text).
