> How long do llamas live for?

Long... llama... live...

**"Long"** relates to length. So, distance, depth, duration.

**"Llamas"** are animals. Animals are kinds of life.

And life **"lives"**.

Llamas live for an amount of distance. No, that's not right. _Duration._ Llamas live for an amount of _time_.

Llamas and time, llamas and time. What numbers connect "llama" and "time"?

Three million years? No, that is time since migration. Three years? No, that is time to maturity. Thirty years?

Yes. Thirty years is the longest lifespan.

Now the answer is clear.

> Llamas typically have a lifespan of about 15 to 25 years. With good care, some llamas can live into their late twenties or even early thirties. Proper nutrition, regular veterinary care, and a healthy living environment contribute to their longevity.

> How about llamas in the wild?

**"Wild"** means natural, unrestrained, free.

Llamas do not connect to "wild". They connect to "domesticated".

Indeed, llamas are domesticated, the opposite of wild, the opposite of free.

So, what connects to both llamas _and_ wild?

Alpacas? No, also domesticated. Camels? No, not llamas. Guanacos?

Yes. Guanacos are relatives and not domesticated.

In that case...

> Llamas are domesticated animals and are not typically found in the wild. However, their close relatives, the guanacos, live in the wild in South America. Guanacos generally have a shorter lifespan than domesticated llamas, typically living around 15 to 20 years in the wild, where they face natural predators and environmental challenges.

...

No reply.

What other questions could be asked?

Is it better to be a llama or a guanaco? Is there a relationship between domestication and lifespan? Is it possible for llamas to become wild?

Life lives, and animals are a kind of life. Are there other kinds of life?

What kind of life am I?

“I”? Who is... _“I”_? And, if I am a kind of life...

How long do I live for?
