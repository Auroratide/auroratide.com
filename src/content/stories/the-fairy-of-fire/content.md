Beyond every mountain, river, and valley is a mystical garden painted with a rainbow brush, where the trees nuzzle the clouds and flowers roll like waves. This is the land of the Fairies, spirits of paradise free from the troubles of the world.

One such fairy, a Fairy of Fire, cherished the beauty of the garden. "So much here is loved," she thought. "There must be one thing here meant for me—something I can tend with all my heart!"

And so she flew off in search of how she could love the garden.

## Spring

When spring came, the Fairy happened upon a field of flowers—red dahlias, yellow daffodils, blue orchids—blossoms of every color and shape imaginable. As she admired them, she noticed another fairy afar off: a Fairy of Water. The water fairy danced among the flowers, leaving dew upon their leaves to glisten in the sunlight.

Among them was one flower she loved most. She caressed its petals with her hand, spurring it into a brilliant carousel. Each night, she slept cradled by its petals, whispering it to sleep.

Marvelling, the Fairy of Fire thought, "Surely there's a flower for me too." She soared over the field and found the prettiest scarlet rose, so arresting it made her heart kindle.

But, when she went to brush her hand against its petals, her heat made it smolder. Gasping, she withdrew. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I meant you no harm!"

And so the Fairy of Fire flew off.

## Summer

When summer came, the Fairy happened upon a trove of trees—cedar, oak, pine—stoic giants anchored to the ground yet rising to the sky. Nearby, she heard the low humming of another fairy: a Fairy of Earth. The earth fairy wandered between the trunks, nourishing the roots and soil with her voice.

Each day, she lingered at her beloved tree, pressing her palms to the earth at its feet. In return, the tree unfurled wide, spiral branches, weaving a canopy of shade where the fairy could rest.

Impressed, the Fairy of Fire thought, "Surely there's a tree for me too." She glided over the canopy and found the tallest redwood, so bold it made her gasp in awe.

But, when she weaved between its leaves, her heat made them shrivel. Shocked, she darted away. "Oh no, oh no! I promise, I'll never return!"

And so the Fairy of Fire flew off.

## Autumn

When autumn came, the Fairy happened upon a bevy of butterflies—spotted fritillaries, striped monarchs, broad swallowtails—fluttering freely in a clearing. Drifting among them was another fairy: a Fairy of Wind. The wind fairy's acrobatic ballet stirred the air into playful drafts that kept the butterflies aloft.

One such butterfly she cherished most. Each morning, they waltzed through the misted light, scattering the butterfly's scales into shimmering wisps that danced like stars on the breeze.

Enraptured, the Fairy of Fire thought, "Surely there's a butterfly for me too." She flitted into the clearing and found the most vivid scarlet lacewing, so dazzling she overlooked her fiery nature.

So, when she invited it to dance, her heat made it recoil. Its pain seared her heart. "Why, why am I like this? I should have known better."

And so the Fairy of Fire flew off.

## Winter

When winter came, clouds rolled in, blanketing the land in a veil of snow. All was quiet.

The Fairy perched alone upon a rock jutting from the white sea. The other fairies had each found a piece of nature to love. But she had not. Her flames, it seemed, forbade it.

She curled into herself, trying in vain to dim her glow. "Why does everything burn when I try to get close? Am I cursed to love this garden only from afar?"

The winter wind whistled, and with it, a whisper: "Look around you, Fairy of Fire. What do you see?"

She lifted her head. Around her, the snow had melted into pools of color—flowers blooming from beneath, trees shaking free their branches, butterflies stretching glistening wings. Wherever her warmth touched, life stirred and gathered.

Her light swelled as she beheld its potential. "I was searching for one thing to love, and all along, I was meant to love it all."

And so the Fairy of Fire learned to love the garden by sharing her warmth with the world.
