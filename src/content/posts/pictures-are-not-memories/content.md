There's something oddly solemn about this picture:

TODO: IMAGE OF MY FEET IN THE WATER

At least, solemn to me. To anyone else, it's just someone's feet in some river water. With a little bit of extra context, though, the picture gains some meaning.

This was the last image ever taken by my phone before (TODO)sucumbing to water damage, water from the very stream it photoed. This river was the last thing it saw, it's last words so to speak. Thousands of photos, and only one can be the last.

## What I lost

I don't automatically back up my photos.

After big trips, I filter everything down to the most memorable 25%, saving them somewhere permanent. I organize the images into chronological order, so that in the future I can just scroll through them and in some sense "relive" the trip as it had happened.

The moment my phone fell into the river, I lost all* my pictures from my three-week trip in Iceland. "Reliving" the trip would no longer be possible, or so I thought.

> [!NOTE]
> *Almost all, technically. I salvaged ten photos simply because I had already shared them with friends, and it so happens I had sent the river photo to my brother right after taking it.

## What I gained

This event made me question: Why did I value those photos to begin with?

I valued them because they helped me **remember** significant things in my life. Maybe that's obvious, yet what wasn't obvious was what I found significant.

I wanted to remember:

* The journey leading up to the photo.
* The emotions I felt at the time.
* What I thought was novel about the moment.
* Stories from people I met.
* How my bonds with my friends strengthened.

?TODO MORE COMDLUCING THOUGHTS

## A Memory is worth 1000 pictures

Here's an image of the Big Dipper stellar constellation I took while in Iceland:

TODO: BIG DIPPER IMAGE

In all honesty, it's not the best stellar image in the world, because phone cameras can only do so much. But why did I take it?

* **Journey**: My brother and I drove up a dirt mountain to get away from all the city lights, because we wanted to see the Northern Lights. Even if we couldn't (we didn't), we'd still see a beautiful night sky.
* **Emotions**: At first impatience because we had to wait in the car five hours, and it was below freezing temperatures. But once I stood outside, I felt a sense of connection to people who lived long before me, knowing I was seeing a similar sky they once saw.
* **Novelty**: With city light pollution, it is impossible to actually make out the Milky Way galaxy's dusty clouds.
* **People**: Hours before, I met an old fisherman in a small Iceland village who collected volcanic rocks as a hobby
* **Bonds**:
