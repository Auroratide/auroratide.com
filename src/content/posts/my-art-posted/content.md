Just recently added a new section to this website: [stuff I've drawn](/art)!

I'm not really an artist, but I'll occassionally fiddle with colors and shapes in a vague attempt to illustrate something coherent. Mostly I've drawn fictional characters of, now essentially abandoned, fictional ideas I've had over the years.

The aim of sharing these things is to encourage me to improve over time, both by becoming mechanically better and by diversifying the portfolio. But also, it's to make me less anxious about being a tad perfectionist: sure, I'm not the _best_ drawer nor am I even _good_, but that shouldn't be a hindrance to doing something I enjoy, and I think that is a useful paradigm for many others as well.

If you're wondering what I use, at least as of this post I generally use [Krita](https://krita.org) and a somewhat ordinary mouse.
