**The Archive of Random Material** (<abbr>TARM</abbr>) is basically an external memory storage for various things I read and watch. Much of what I consume is educational, yet I've unfortunately found that most of it leaks out of this silly brain of mine. Now, instead of leaking into the ether, it can leak onto this tiny website!

* Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) using [partial hydration](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/partial-hydration/), since the site is mostly static.
