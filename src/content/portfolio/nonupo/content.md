**Nonupo** is a two-player math strategy game that could in theory be played with just paper, a pencil, and 10-sided die.

* The game is played on a 6 &times; 6 grid.
* On a players turn, they role the 10-sided die to get a number. They may then either place that number or one of + or - into a cell in the grid.
* Players take turns doing this until there are no more cells in the grid.
* Player one's score is calculated by considering each row a math expression, then totalling each row.
* Player two's score is calculated by considering each column a math expression, then totalling each row.
* The player whose score is closest to 0 wins!

This was my first major project using an object-oriented language: ActionScript 3, aka the now-dead Flash. Despite being one of my first projects, its still one of the ones I'm most proud of.

## Unfortunately...

Flash is no longer a thing, so the original game is unplayable. If you have some means to play Flash content, you can **[download the SWF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uZF6qAG2yzzpuVJ2Wtxk2YoB-auNkAWH/view?usp=sharing)**.
