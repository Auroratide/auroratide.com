**Cosmic Upheaval** is a side-scroll shooting game in which you play the role of an anti-matter star. You were somehow teleported into a real-matter universe, and all the real-matter stars want to kill you! Now you must navigate the universe while ensuring that these stars do not annihilate all of your mass.

* Made using Gamemaker for a one-week game jam constest when I was a first-year college student.
* The twist is shooting expends your own mass (HP), so every shot you make counts.
* Five different bosses represent actual stars in our galaxy.

Cosmic Upheaval is only compatible with Windows.
