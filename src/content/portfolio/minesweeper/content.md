This port of Minesweeper is my first major program, written for TI calculators. Using pure TI-BASIC, the programming language I started off with, this version of Minesweeper has three difficulty settings, a custom dimension setter, and a way to track high scores.

I first started learning TI-BASIC early 2008, and if it wasn't for the existence of the TI-Basic Developer, I would not have gotten very far. The vast archive of others' accomplishments motivated me, and its shear wealth of information equipped me.

Unfortunately, this Minesweeper program is among the only surviving programs from my TI-BASIC period. Most of them have since been deleted or lost. At the very least, I still have this remnant from my past.

The code for this program is open source and free to use without my explicit permission.
