The Standard Template is Wikidot's first Bootstrap-enabled template site. It provides basic pages and facilities to help others get started on their new projects. Wikidot users can hence clone the site and modify it in order to fit their needs. I made templates for notebook, blog, and generic sites.

Before the Standard Template, Wikidot web templates were not mobile compatible, so this site is ideal for those hoping to make a website in the modern era. It is natively built with Twitter Bootstrap in order to guarantee site responsiveness. The template was eventually recognized as [Wikidot's primary mobile solution](http://blog.wikidot.com/blog:new-bootstrap-website-template).

In addition to the generic site, I created two other templates based off of it.

* The [Notebook Template](http://notebooks.wikidot.com/) is a specialization that emulates Microsoft's OneNote in order to provide users with an easy-to-use webbook.
* The [Blog Template](http://blogs-template.wikidot.com/) allows Wikidot users to easily create and maintain online blogs.

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't use these in reality. Wikidot has since been completely abandoned by its developers.
