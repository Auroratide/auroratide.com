**Pokemon 5e Reference** is a website dedicated to Dungeons and Dragons homebrew, adding Pokemon to a world of magic!

[Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/) is a popular game where people act as characters in a world of magic to defeat evil. I like to think of it as _collaborative storytelling_, as the people playing essentially create the story of their characters' adventures. As an inherently creative game, the creation of <dfn>homebrew</dfn>, or custom content, is incredibly common, personalizing and expanding an already expressive universe.

[Pokemon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) is a series of games and shows where people collect powerful animals to battle each other. The community organized by [@JOEtheDM](https://twitter.com/JOEtheDM) created an assortment of custom content for Dungeons and Dragons, including converting every single Pokemon into a useable monster.

## The Website

The content was only available as PDFs, though. To make it easier to find content, I converted the PDFs into an online reference. Doing so makes it trivially easy to find specific pokemon and immediately link to what moves they can use/learn.

I built this using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), and designed the UI based on [Pokemon Sword and Shield](https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/). All content except for post-seventh generation pokemon was written by @JOEtheDM and the community.
