**Pokemon 5e Reference** is a website dedicated to Dungeons and Dragons homebrew, adding Pokemon to a world of magic!

* I converted a bunch of PDFs into a structured format and an API that the website uses to make interactivity possible.
* Trainers can be managed online, without the need to create an account. This is possible using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
* The website is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), designed after the UI of [Pokemon Sword and Shield](https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/).
* At least **100** people use or have used the site!

	<summary>What is Dungeons and Dragons?</summary>
	<p><a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">Dungeons and Dragons</a> is a popular game where people act as characters in a world of magic to defeat evil. I like to think of it as _collaborative storytelling_, as the people playing essentially create the story of their characters' adventures. As an inherently creative game, the creation of <dfn>homebrew</dfn>, or custom content, is incredibly common, personalizing and expanding an already expressive universe.</p>

	<summary>What is Pokemon?</summary>
	<p><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/">Pokemon</a> is a series of games and shows where people collect powerful animals to battle each other. The community created an assortment of custom content for Dungeons and Dragons, including converting every single Pokemon into a useable monster.</p>
