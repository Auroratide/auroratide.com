TAGD-IGDA (Texas Aggie Game Developers) is a collegiate student organization that focuses on game development and design. Affiliated with the International Game Developers Association, the goal is to help prepare members for the game development industry. I made this site so that members can always know what's going on.

I was a member of the Texas Aggie Game Developers for all four years I was in college. In that time, I served as webmaster, development chair, and president, participated in a number of game jams, watched Wreck-It Ralph, and made a good number of memories. I wanted TAGD to be unique among the other campus organizations by giving it a highly customized website showcasing the work of our members.

Unfortunately, the site is no longer used as knowledge of its maintenance has been lost through the years.
