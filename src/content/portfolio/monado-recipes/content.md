Monado Recipes is a fan-made repository of recipes based on food found in the [Xenoblade Chronicles](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Xenoblade_Wiki) games.

Really, it's one big creative culinary exercise: how do you take fantasy ingredients like "Mookah Flour" and create a "Pan-Fried Tatari"? What even is a tatari anyway?

* Made with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). The website is simple, so the tech stack is simple!
* Highly accessible web design.
* Designed to easily print as well.
* And none of that "here's 20 pages of recipe backstory" BS before the actual recipe!
