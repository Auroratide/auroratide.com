    <h2>Dreaming</h2>
    <p>Stories fascinate me. They surround us in the forms of books, games, movies, anecdotes. Yet, many stories are fictional, completely invented by the imaginative wanderings of a creative person.</p>
    <p>I have had many such wanderings, creating colorful characters, envisioning their worlds, and forming the events that shape their lives.</p>
    <p>Whether it be about a world where magic is coded or about an unassuming girl accidentally uncovering a nationwide conspiracy, there&apos;s always a story to tell. My aspiration is to put many of these dreams to paper.</p>
    <p>Why write when I&apos;m primarily a programmer? If I&apos;m going to be honest, we programmers can learn much from the art of storytelling! After all, creativity flourishes when two worlds collide.</p>
