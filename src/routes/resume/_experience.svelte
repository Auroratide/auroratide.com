            <ul>

                <li>Led the design of a Domain Specific Language to bridge communication between the business and developers, shortening the development lifecycle by 40 days.</li>
                <li>Proposed and implemented an architecture that reduced the number of claims our queue needed to process from billions to millions. </li>
                <li>Presented a live view into our data pipeline to the client CEO and CTO, built using Javascript and Express connected to our Kotlin REST API.</li>

                <li>Created a visualization of the curriculum which doubled the program's capacity for trainees, enabling the trainer team to identify redundancies.</li>
                <li>Engaged a few dozen trainees in optional sessions about creativity and received feedback about the success of the techniques within their teams.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Created codebase alignment through workshops about state management with Redux Sagas, testing React with Enzyme, and functional testing with Testcafe.</li>
                <li>Established a model for working as a distributed US/India team, which became a standard across multiple teams on the client.</li>
            </ul>
